    "# Correlation vs Causation \n",
    "Correlation says that there is a relationship between some quantity $X$ and some quantity $Y$, while causation says that $X$ causes $Y$. THIS IS NOT THE SAME THING! Check out [this webpage](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) for funny examples of things that are strongly correlated but that make no sense for one of them to cause the other, like number of people who drown in pools vs number of movies Nicolas Cage appears in!\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference problems postulate that there are a set of features (let's call them $W_i$ with $i=1,\\dots,n$) that cause $Y$. However, most of the times the $W_i$ features that cause $Y$ are very abstract and cannot be directly observed. For example, assume $Y$ is quality of life in a country. The $W_i$ features in this case might be things like income inequality, well-being, safety, community and social relationships, etc. which are very hard to measure because they are not well-defined quantities. \n",
    "\n",
    "What can we do then if we cannot measure the $W_i$? The answer is to measure some other set of features $X_i$ that we believe are good approximations for the $W_i$. For example, a value for income inequality can be approximated by measuring the average difference between the highest and lowest wages across corporations, and a value for safety can be approximated by measuring the number of reported robberies in an area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise: can you describe why these quantities are just approximations? do wages contain all the information you need to know about income inequality? how about vacation days? how about employer provided health insurance? \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have some $X_i$ features that we can measure, we can then collect data and build a model, such as a linear regression model to try and understand the effect of the $X_i$ on $Y$, and since we know the $X_i$ are good approximations for the $W_i$, the results can be used to understand the relationship between the $W_i$ and $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that picking a model gives rise to a similar problem. We do not know what the \"true model\" (let's call it $F$) is that describes the relationship between $Y$ and $W_i$ (i.e. $Y = F(W_i)$), so we try and estimate a model (let's call it $f$) of the form $Y = f(X_i)$ that approximates $F(W_i)$, such that the error $F(W_i)-f(X_i)$ is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the prediction problem does not care about what causes $Y$. All it cares about is whether we can predict what $Y$ will be based on the available data $X_i$. In the example above, the prediction problem does not care about income inequality per se, but it cares about whether we can use the average difference in wages in corporations to predict quality of life.
