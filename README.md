# ai4all

# Setup:
- clone this directory 
`cd ai4all_dir`

`git clone https://github.com/agataf/ai4all`
- you should technically request data from the SOC department, but for the three of us I'm putting it up here: 
  * https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYnjfqIxZCrAYc7juV0UplvZlwTNDxJ8?usp=sharing
- download the data to a directory called ai4all_data next to ai4all

`cd ai4all_dir`

`cp path_to_data/ai4all_data .`

- make sure you have jupyter notebook downloaded

`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

`python -m pip install jupyter`

- I'm assuming Python2.7 - let me know if you want to use Python3
- to run jupyter notebook:

`cd ai4all_dir/ai4all`

`jupyter notebook`
