# ai4all

Setup:
- clone this directory 
`git clone https://github.com/agataf/ai4all`
- download the data to a directory called ai4all_data next to ai4all, which includes train.csv
- make sure you have jupyter notebook downloaded
`python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter`
- I'm assuming Python3 - let me know if you want to use Python2.7
- to run jupyter notebook:
`cd ai4all
jupyter notebook`
